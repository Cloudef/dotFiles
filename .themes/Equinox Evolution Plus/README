Known issues
============

Gnome does not support well dark themes, so you may experiment:
* Some ugly controls in HTML forms with Firefox (but you can use Chrome/Chromium insteed)
* A dark background in all you OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents (but you can force the default background color of windows and documents in the application's options).
* Evolution appears particulary ugly: there is a hard-coded color value for the header of the left sidebar, treeview/list headers are displayed in dark, etc.
* Probably many other...
